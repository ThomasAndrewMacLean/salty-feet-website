  <h2>How does it work?</h2>
  <p>
    When planning your trip, you have two options: <em>Social Traveler</em> or
    <em>Free Birds</em>.
  </p>
  <p>
    <em>Social Traveler</em> is a retreat with fixed dates each month. Salty
    Feet organizes daily group activities, giving you a chance to connect with
    others while still having free time to spend however you like.
  </p>
  <p>
    <em>Free Birds</em> offers more flexibility. You choose your travel dates
    and group size, then customize your schedule with activities that suit your
    preferences.
  </p>

        With Social Traveler, daily group activities are already planned and
        included in the price. For the remaining time, you’re free to decide how
        you’d like to spend your day. If you need suggestions or guidance, we’re
        here to help you find the perfect activities.

        The price varies depending on your room choice — shared or private — and
        your airport pick-up location. If you’re joining the retreat with a
        friend, we offer a special rate for sharing a room with your travel
        buddy.

  <h2 class="large-text mb pl">PADI Course</h2>

  <p>
    The PADI Open Water Course is the heart of our retreat. It’s a 3-day
    experience with 2 dives per day, plus plenty of time to relax, chat, and
    soak in the vibe between dives.
  </p>

  <ul class="starlist">
    <li>
      Learn at your own pace: We provide PADI eLearning, so you can complete the
      theory part in advance — no need to spend your holiday buried in a
      textbook!
    </li>
    <li>
      Hands-on training: At our dive center, we kick things off with a quick
      briefing and a short class. Then, it’s time to dive in! We start with
      practical exercises to build your confidence and skills underwater.
    </li>
    <li>
      The perfect first dive spot: Kalamar Bay is an ideal location for
      beginners, with crystal-clear visibility and calm waters — making your
      first dives smooth and unforgettable.
    </li>
    <li>
      After completing the course, you’ll earn your PADI Open Water Diver
      certification — an internationally recognized license that lets you
      explore dive sites around the world!
    </li>
  </ul>
