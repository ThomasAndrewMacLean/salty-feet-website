  <h2>How does it work?</h2>
  <p>
    When planning your trip, you have two options: <em>Social Traveler</em> or
    <em>Free Birds</em>.
  </p>
  <p>
    <em>Social Traveler</em> is a retreat with fixed dates each month. Salty
    Feet organizes daily group activities, giving you a chance to connect with
    others while still having free time to spend however you like.
  </p>
  <p>
    <em>Free Birds</em> offers more flexibility. You choose your travel dates
    and group size, then customize your schedule with activities that suit your
    preferences.
