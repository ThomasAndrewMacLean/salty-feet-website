  <h2>How does it work?</h2>
  <p>
    When planning your trip, you have two options: <em>Social Traveler</em> or
    <em>Free Birds</em>.
  </p>
  <p>
    <em>Social Traveler</em> is a retreat with fixed dates each month. Salty
    Feet organizes daily group activities, giving you a chance to connect with
    others while still having free time to spend however you like.
  </p>
  <p>
    <em>Free Birds</em> offers more flexibility. You choose your travel dates
    and group size, then customize your schedule with activities that suit your
    preferences.
  </p>

        With Social Traveler, daily group activities are already planned and
        included in the price. For the remaining time, you’re free to decide how
        you’d like to spend your day. If you need suggestions or guidance, we’re
        here to help you find the perfect activities.

      <h3>Kalkan Old Town</h3>
      <p>
        Kalkan Old Town is a charming, picturesque maze of narrow streets,
        whitewashed houses, and colorful bougainvillea draping over balconies.
        Once a small Greek fishing village, it has preserved its historical
        charm while blending in cozy cafes, boutique shops, and rooftop
        restaurants with stunning sea views.
      </p>
      <p>
        Strolling through the cobbled streets, you’ll find artisan stores
        selling handmade jewelry, ceramics, and Turkish textiles, alongside
        traditional tavernas serving fresh seafood and local mezes. The harbor,
        lined with boats and waterfront restaurants, is perfect for a sunset
        walk or a seaside dinner.
      </p>
      <p>
        Best of all — Kalkan Old Town is just 1 kilometer away from our
        accommodation and dive resort, making it an easy and scenic walk to
        explore the heart of the town after a day of adventure.
      </p>
      <p>
        It’s the perfect spot to unwind, soak up the local culture, and enjoy
        the laid-back Mediterranean vibe!

      <h3>Boat Tour</h3>
      <p>
        The boat tour is one of the best activities to experience — a full-day
        adventure exploring Kalkan’s stunning coastline. The journey starts from
        the harbor in Kalkan Old Town, where you’ll begin the day with tea and
        coffee as the boat sets sail toward hidden, private bays. The boat stops
        at around five different bays, including the famous Mouse and Snake
        Islands. At each stop, you can snorkel in the clear waters, try
        paddleboarding, or enjoy a natural clay bath — a refreshing, fun way to
        rejuvenate.
      </p>
      <p>
        A generous lunch is served on deck, featuring fresh seafood, traditional
        mezes, and local flavors. After a day of swimming and exploring, you’ll
        be treated to fresh fruit and homemade cakes — a perfect way to finish
        the experience. Throughout the trip, you can enjoy aperitifs, wine, and
        other beverages while unwinding on deck and taking in the beautiful
        views. It’s a day filled with relaxation, adventure, and great food — an
        unforgettable way to experience Kalkan from the sea.

      <h3>Kalkan Market</h3>
      <p>
        Kalkan Market is a lively, open-air bazaar set up under a large tent
        every Thursday, where locals gather to shop. It’s the perfect place to
        immerse yourself in the local culture while browsing a colorful variety
        of goods — from fragrant spices and teas to handmade carpets, clothing,
        and freshly picked fruits and vegetables. Among the stalls, you’ll find
        village women preparing Gözleme, a traditional Turkish pancake cooked on
        a griddle, with a variety of fillings, including cheese, potatoes,
        spinach, and other vegetarian options. We’ve reserved a spot for you and
        the rest of the group to relax and enjoy this tasty, fresh-made treat —
        the perfect way to recharge after a fun day exploring the market.

      <h3>Patara Ancient City</h3>
      <p>
        Patara Ancient City — once a thriving Lycian port, is now an
        awe-inspiring archaeological site near Kalkan. Known as the birthplace
        of Saint Nicholas (the inspiration for Santa Claus), Patara boasts a
        grand theater, a stunning ancient parliament building, and a monumental
        lighthouse — the oldest known in the world. Wander through its timeless
        streets, blending history with breathtaking landscapes, just steps away
        from Patara’s famous sandy beach.

      <h3>Patara Beach</h3>
      <p>
        Patara Beach is a stunning, unspoiled stretch of golden sand that runs
        for 18 kilometers, making it one of the longest beaches in Turkey.
        Nestled near the ancient city of Patara, this beach offers a
        breathtaking mix of natural beauty and historical charm. It’s a
        protected area due to the endangered loggerhead sea turtles (Caretta
        caretta) that nest here, ensuring the beach remains peaceful and
        undeveloped. With its soft dunes, warm turquoise waters, and mesmerizing
        sunsets, Patara Beach is perfect for sunbathing, swimming, or simply
        enjoying nature’s quiet magic.
