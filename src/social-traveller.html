  <h2>How does it work?</h2>
  <p>
    When planning your trip, you have two options: <em>Social Traveler</em> or
    <em>Free Birds</em>.
  </p>
  <p>
    <em>Social Traveler</em> is a retreat with fixed dates each month. Salty
    Feet organizes daily group activities, giving you a chance to connect with
    others while still having free time to spend however you like.
  </p>
  <p>
    <em>Free Birds</em> offers more flexibility. You choose your travel dates
    and group size, then customize your schedule with activities that suit your
    preferences.

        With Social Traveler, daily group activities are already planned and
        included in the price. For the remaining time, you’re free to decide how
        you’d like to spend your day. If you need suggestions or guidance, we’re
        here to help you find the perfect activities.

        The price varies depending on your room choice — shared or private — and
        your airport pick-up location. If you’re joining the retreat with a
        friend, we offer a special rate for sharing a room with your travel
        buddy.
