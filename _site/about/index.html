    <p>
      I’ll be your guide on this journey—and your dive instructor! I grew up
      spending my summers on the coast of Kalkan, right in the heart of Turkey’s
      Mediterranean paradise. My family has been running a dive school here for
      over 25 years, so you could say the sea raised me.
    </p>
    <p>
      While other kids were learning to walk, I was learning to dive. Since I
      was little, I dreamed of becoming an instructor, and now, I get to share
      this incredible underwater world with you. Whether you're a first-time
      diver or a seasoned explorer, you’re in safe hands.

          My love for the ocean started before I can even remember. At five
          years old, I took my first breath underwater using my father’s second
          air source, wide-eyed and mesmerized by the world below. Since then,
          diving has been a part of me—it’s where I feel the most alive.
        </p>
        <p>
          Growing up in Kalkan’s diving scene meant that the sea was my
          playground, my classroom, and my home. I saw firsthand how the ocean
          could transform people, giving them a sense of freedom, calm, and
          wonder. I knew I wanted to be the one to guide others into that magic.

          At 20, I took a detour from the sea and moved to Ghent, Belgium, to
          study at LUCA School of Arts. That’s where I discovered immersive
          installation art and realized that diving and art share the same
          essence: they transport you, make you feel weightless, and connect you
          to something bigger than yourself.
        </p>
        <p>
          After years of living between Istanbul’s energy, Kalkan’s peaceful
          waters, and Ghent’s creative pulse, I realized how powerful it is to
          slow down. In a world that moves so fast, I wanted to create a space
          for people to escape the hustle of everyday life and reconnect with a
          more mindful, unhurried rhythm—where the sea, nature, and simple
          moments remind us what it means to truly be present.

    <h3 class="text-white text-center text-xxl">Kalkan Dive Centre</h3>

    <p>
      The center is owned by my uncle, Altan, and his wife, Vicky. They built
      this business from the ground up and have been running it together for
      over 25 years. Altan’s diving journey began in the Caribbean, where he
      worked on a cruise ship and fell in love with the underwater world.
      Dreaming of bringing PADI diving to the Mediterranean, he found his way to
      Kalkan, where he met Vicky—a British travel expert bringing visitors to
      this beautiful coastal town.
    </p>
    <p>
      Together, they built more than just a business; they built a community. In
      the early years, they offered water sports, guided tours, and other
      adventure activities, helping shape Kalkan’s reputation as a vibrant
      travel destination. Today, their focus is on diving, catering, and
      accommodation, creating a full experience where guests can explore the
      underwater world, enjoy great food, and relax in a welcoming atmosphere.
      As one of the first to contribute to Kalkan’s tourism, Altan and Vicky’s
      passion for the sea and hospitality continues to make this place special.

        <p>
          Captain Ender (my dad) keeps our dive boat running smoothly and is
          also an experienced underwater tour guide, leading divers through the
          stunning dive sites around Kalkan.
        </p>
        <p>
          Growing up, my dad worked in different places, always encouraging me
          to explore, travel, and keep discovering. I’m deeply grateful for the
          incredible world he introduced me to—the breathtaking marine life, the
          beauty of nature, and the endless sense of adventure.
        </p>
        <p>
          While he worked on the boat, I was never far behind—snorkeling
          alongside him with my mask and fins. The ocean was my playground, and
          he was my guide. Then, at age 7, I finally got my own scuba gear and
          could truly dive into the world he had been showing me from the
          surface.
        </p>
        <p>
          Diving with him was more than just an activity—it was a way of life, a
          connection to the sea, and the beginning of a lifelong passion that I
          now share with others.

        <p>
          Emre (my cousin) and I grew up together at the beach club, always on
          the move—chasing the air bubbles from our fathers, collecting
          seashells, discovering marine life, and, of course, eating way too
          much ice cream. Not much has changed.
        </p>
        <p>
          Now, as grown-ups, we invite friends from all over the world to
          experience the magic of coastal life with us. Whether it’s diving,
          boat tours, sunset chasing, quad biking, BBQ nights, or simply
          embracing the slow rhythm of the sea, we love sharing the life we grew
          up with. We still feed our inner child and help others reconnect with
          theirs—stepping away from the hustle of everyday life to rediscover a
          sense of adventure.
        </p>
        <p>
          We became PADI Instructors together, traveled across Asia, and kept
          chasing our dreams side by side. While I moved to Belgium, Emre took
          his passion for food to Bulgaria to study Culinary Arts. From there,
          he worked and traveled across Australia, cooked in restaurants in
          Bilbao and Malta, and kept exploring the world.
        </p>
        <p>
          But no matter how far we go, we always find our way back to Kalkan—our
          anchor, our home, where the sea and our family always welcome us back
          for another unforgettable season.

        <p>
          Lidya, Emre’s sister and my cousin, is the youngest of our crew—but
          don’t let that fool you! She just turned 18, but she’s been part of
          the ocean life since she was little. Back in the day, she would swim
          around the beach club wearing a mermaid tail, freediving effortlessly
          like she truly belonged to the sea.
        </p>
        <p>
          Last summer, she trained with us as an intern and officially became a
          Divemaster. She’s an incredible assistant—calm, reliable, and always
          full of energy. Kids adore her, and she brings so much fun to every
          dive!
        </p>
        <p>
          Right now, she’s working on getting her captain’s license (following
          in her dad’s footsteps!) and has big plans to work on cruise ships
          while also pursuing her passion for fashion in her free time.
        </p>
        <p>
          One thing’s for sure—wherever she goes, she’ll always find her way
          back to the sea
